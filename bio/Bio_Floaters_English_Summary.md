## Overview and Epidemiology

### Definition and Prevalence

**Floaters (Vitreous Opacities)** are visual phenomena where patients subjectively perceive moving shadows such as dots, threads, webs, or other shapes in their field of vision. These floating objects are actually shadows cast by opaque substances within the vitreous humor onto the retina.

**Epidemiological Data:**
- Approximately 70-80% of people will experience floaters symptoms in their lifetime
- Age distribution shows bimodal pattern:
  - First peak: 20-40 years (myopia-related)
  - Second peak: Over 50 years (aging-related degeneration)
- Risk factors include aging, high myopia, ocular trauma, and inflammatory diseases

### Key Terminology
- **Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)**: Separation of vitreous posterior cortex from retinal internal limiting membrane
- **Weiss Ring**: Annular opacity formed during PVD
- **Synchysis**: Physiological liquefaction of vitreous gel with aging

## Basic Anatomy and Physiology

### Ocular Structure

**Three-layered Eyeball Structure:**
1. **Fibrous Layer**: Sclera (outer) + Cornea (anterior 1/6)
2. **Vascular Layer**: Iris, ciliary body, choroid
3. **Retina**: Neural sensory layer containing photoreceptors

### Vitreous System

**Vitreous Characteristics:**
- Location: Transparent gel between lens and retina
- Volume: About 4/5 of eyeball volume (4-5ml)
- Composition: 98-99% water, 1-2% solid components
- Weight: Approximately 4 grams

**Microstructure Components:**
```
Vitreous Collagen Network:
├── Collagen Fibrils (Type II collagen)
│   ├── Diameter: 20-200nm
│   ├── Arrangement: Three-dimensional mesh framework
│   └── Function: Maintain vitreous structural stability
├── Hyaluronic Acid Molecules
│   ├── Molecular Weight: 10^6-10^7 Da
│   ├── Structure: Long-chain polysaccharide polymer
│   └── Function: Provide viscoelastic properties
└── Vitreous Cortex and Stroma Zones
    ├── Cortical Layer: Peripheral dense region
    ├── Stromal Layer: Central sparse region
    └── PVD Interface Boundary
```

**Physiological Functions:**
1. Optical transparency: Ensure light transmission to retina
2. Buffer protection: Absorb shock, protect retina from mechanical injury
3. Metabolic support: Participate in aqueous humor circulation
4. Developmental guidance: Important role in embryonic eye development

## Pathophysiology and Classification

### Vitreous Liquefaction Process

**Physiological Aging Mechanism:**
- Collagen fiber degeneration: Progressive loosening with age
- Hyaluronic acid degradation: Enzymatic breakdown reduces viscosity
- Water content changes: Relative increase in liquid component

### Clinical Classification

**Etiological Classification:**
1. **Physiological Floaters**
   - Age-related vitreous degeneration
   - High myopia vitreous abnormalities
   - Mild and stable symptoms

2. **Pathological Floaters**
   - Retinal tears/detachment
   - Vitreous hemorrhage
   - Intraocular inflammation
   - Intraocular tumors

**Morphological Classification:**
- Dot-shaped floaters (<0.1mm diameter)
- Thread-like floaters (0.1-1mm length)
- Web-like floaters (complex branching structures)
- Ring-shaped floaters (complete or incomplete rings)
