# 专注力冥想疗愈

## 概述

专注力冥想疗愈将传统正念练习与现代认知科学相结合，以增强持续注意力、选择性注意力和认知灵活性。这种治疗方法借鉴佛教冥想传统、当代神经科学研究和循证心理干预来解决注意力缺陷并提高心理清晰度。

## 核心治疗原则

### 1. 通过正念调节注意力

**Key Components:**
- **Present-moment awareness**: Anchoring attention in immediate sensory experience
- **Non-judgmental observation**: Observing thoughts and sensations without evaluation
- **Gentle redirection**: Compassionately returning attention when it wanders

### 2. 基于神经可塑性的训练

**Mechanisms:**
- **Anterior cingulate cortex strengthening**: Improved conflict monitoring
- **Prefrontal cortex enhancement**: Better executive control
- **Default mode network regulation**: Reduced mind-wandering
- **Attention network integration**: Coordinated activation of dorsal and ventral attention systems
