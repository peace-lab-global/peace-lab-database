### 个人层面干预

#### Attention Restoration Technique (ART)
**Core Protocol:**
1. **Nature-based breaks** (10-15 minutes):
   - Views of natural elements or outdoor spaces
   - Plant presence in workspace
   - Nature sound environments
2. **Micro-break scheduling**:
   - 5-minute rest periods every 45-60 minutes
   - Physical movement and stretching
   - Eye relaxation exercises
3. **Transition rituals**:
   - Clear beginnings and endings to work periods
   - Mindful shifting between different types of tasks
   - Conscious closure of completed projects

#### Digital Attention Management
**Technology Optimization:**
1. **Notification hygiene**:
   - Batch processing communications
   - Strategic timing of email checking
   - App-based focus timers and blockers
2. **Interface simplification**:
   - Minimalist desktop organization
   - Single-task browser usage
   - Customized productivity dashboards
3. **Screen ergonomics**:
   - Optimal monitor positioning
   - Blue light filtering during evening hours
   - Regular screen break reminders

### 团队和组织方法

#### Collective Focus Protocols
**Group Implementation:**
1. **Focus time blocks**:
   - Organization-wide quiet hours
   - Protected deep work periods
   - Collaborative scheduling of interruption-free zones
2. **Meeting optimization**:
   - Agendas with clear objectives and time limits
   - Standing meetings for brevity
   - Digital meeting tools that enhance rather than fragment attention
3. **Culture development**:
   - Recognition of focus time as valuable contribution
   - Training in respectful interruption protocols
   - Leadership modeling of attention-friendly behaviors

#### Workspace Design Interventions
**Physical Environment Modifications:**
1. **Zoned work areas**:
   - Quiet focus zones for individual work
   - Collaboration spaces for interactive tasks
   - Social areas for informal connection
2. **Biophilic elements**:
   - Living walls and plant installations
   - Natural light maximization
   - Water features for ambient sound masking
3. **Flexible furniture arrangements**:
   - Adjustable height workstations
   - Moveable partitions for privacy control
   - Comfortable seating options for different work styles
