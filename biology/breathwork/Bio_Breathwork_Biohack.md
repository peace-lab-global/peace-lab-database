| **Bio-Coherence** | 5.5 - 6 breaths/min | Baroreflex resonance. | Heart-Brain Alignment. | HeartMath; EliteHRV. | The "Sweet Spot" of the human autonomic nervous system for peak resilience. | Lehrer, P. M., et al. (2000). *Psychosomatic Medicine*. |
| **HRV (Heart Rate Var.)** | - | Beat-to-beat variability. | Marker of Adaptability. | Oura; Whoop; Apple Watch. | Higher HRV consistently correlates with better emotion regulation and lower mortality. | Thayer, J. F., et al. (2012). *Cortex*. |
| **Vagal Brake** | - | Parasympathetic dominance. | Social Engagement System. | Slow exhalations. | Polyvagal concept: using breath to "Step on the brake" of a racing heart. | Porges, S. W. (2011). *The Polyvagal Theory*. |
| **RSA** (Synch) | - | Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia. | Efficient gas exchange. | Deep diaphragmatic breath. | HR increases on inhalation (Symp), decreases on exhalation (Para); exhalation focus is key for calm. | *Applied Psychophysiology & Biofeedback*. |
